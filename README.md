# Mentor-Mentee-Matching-Model
In this project, I designed a model to effectively match mentors and mentees based on their profiles, preferences, and goals. The model aims to optimize compatibility scores by considering various attributes, including:

  1. Skills: Evaluating the expertise of mentors against the aspirations of mentees.
  2. Goals: Aligning the objectives of mentees with the relevant experience of mentors.
  3. Communication Preferences: Matching mentors and mentees based on their preferred modes of communication.
  4. Time Commitment: Ensuring that both parties have compatible availability for meetings.

This model leverages data-driven techniques to facilitate meaningful mentorship relationships, enhancing the overall mentoring experience. The repository includes the algorithm implementation, sample data, and instructions for usage.
